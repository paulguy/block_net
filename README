block_net libc connect() wrapper

Uses LD_PRELOAD to wrap connect() to prevent access to the internet.  Access is
allowed to 127.0.0.0/8 and all other services but IPv4 are passed straight
through.  (I don't have any IPv6 support where I am now so I have no real way
to develop this.)  Additionally, dlsym() is wrapped to prevent a process
bypassing the dynamic linker for libc.  (Fixes Wine)

USAGE: ./block_net_run.sh <program> [arguments]
You can use the block_net_run.sh script, passing your program and arguments to
it, or you can set LD_PRELOAD yourself with:

export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/block_net/\$LIB/block_net.so

To get a fully blocked shell.  The $LIB is necessary for multilib environments;
make sure the $ is escaped so it's parsed by ld.so and not the shell.  You can
select lib32 or lib64 specifically if you only want it to affect one or the
other, or your system only has support for one of them.

Problems:
If a process uses dlvsym() directly to get the pointer to connect(), it will
bypass LD_PRELOAD and the dlsym() protection.  If anyone has any hints to a
solution for this, I would like to know.

ncurses programs may get a screwed up terminal at times, you can get around
this by setting BN_SILENT in your environment, value doesn't matter.  The
tradeoff is this reduces stealth.

A process may be able to unset or detect the presence of LD_PRELOAD to
circumvent this library.  Again, hints on this would be helpful.

Not endian-safe (little-endian only).  Might fix if there's demand for it.
